### 1. Context Switch Example with Shell and Cat Process  
**Key Points**  
- Four context switches occur during a switch from one process to another (e.g., shell to cat).  
- The context switches are:  
  1. User space to kernel space stack of shell  
  2. Switch to kernel stack of scheduler  
  3. Switch to kernel stack of destination process (cat)  
  4. Kernel stack to user space stack of cat  
- The overhead of context switches includes saving/restoring registers, cache locality loss, and TLB flush.  
- Kernel context switching occurs explicitly in the kernel, via an assembly-level `switch` function.  
- The `switch` function saves registers, switches the stack pointer, restores registers, and returns on the new stack. Detailed assembly manipulations lead to efficient stack switching.  

**Problem statement:**  
Explain and enumerate the sequence of context switches when a user process shell calls another process cat, focusing on user and kernel context saving and switching.

**Solution:**  
- Upon system call transition: save user context of shell (user registers).  
- Enter kernel stack of shell’s kernel context.  
- Call `switch` function to switch from shell kernel stack to scheduler kernel stack (save shell kernel registers, switch kernel stack pointer).  
- Scheduler calls `switch` again to switch from scheduler kernel stack to cat kernel stack (saving scheduler context, loading cat kernel context).  
- Cat kernel stack restores its registers and then switches into cat user space (load user registers).  
- Total of 4 context switches (user→kernel shell, kernel shell→scheduler, scheduler→kernel cat, kernel cat→user cat).  

_Summary: This example is key to understanding the overhead of context switching in the kernel, highlighting why context switches are expensive and why efficient switching mechanisms are important. Good to be able to reproduce and explain this example on exams._

### 2. Exam-Relevant Question: Trade Off Between User Space and Kernel Space in Sleeping and Process Switching  
**Key Points**  
- A process cannot put itself to sleep without kernel support; kernel manages sleeping and waking.  
- Switching away from a sleeping process enables better CPU utilization but imposes overhead due to saving/restoring states, cache/TLB flushes.  
- Tradeoffs involve balancing CPU productive use versus overhead of context switches.  
- Understanding these tradeoffs and mechanisms is fundamental.  
- If asked on the exam: "Why can't a user process put itself to sleep?" and "What costs are involved in switching processes?"  

_Summary: This conceptual question on process sleeping and CPU switching is fundamental, emphasizing the kernel’s role and overhead costs. Be prepared to explain these philosophical and system design ideas on exams._

### 3. Assembly `switch` Function for Kernel Context Switching  
**Key Points**  
- The `switch` function takes two arguments (old and new context pointers) passed on the stack.  
- It saves callee-saved registers (EBP, EBX, ESI, EDI) of the old context.  
- It saves the current kernel stack pointer into old context structure.  
- It loads the new kernel stack pointer from the new context into ESP register, effectively switching stacks.  
- Pops callee-saved registers from new context stack, then returns.  
- This is the fundamental mechanism for kernel context switching.  
- Highlighted that these stack switch instructions are not privileged and can be done in user space.  

**Problem statement:**  
Describe how the `switch` function switches kernel contexts at the assembly level, explaining key instructions that save the old context and restore the new context.

**Solution:**  
- Load old context pointer into EAX, new context pointer into EDX (from stack arguments).  
- Push callee-saved registers to current stack (old context).  
- Save ESP (stack pointer) into old context pointed by EAX.  
- Load ESP from new context pointer (EDX), switching stacks.  
- Pop callee-saved registers from new stack (new context).  
- Return, now executing in the new kernel stack context.  

_Summary: Knowing these assembly-level details and the logic behind the `switch` function is important. If asked on the exam, you should be able to enumerate the steps of kernel context switch at this low level._

### 4. One-to-One vs. Many-to-One vs. Hybrid Threading Models  
**Key Points**  
- **One-to-One model:** Each user space thread maps to one kernel space thread.  
  - Advantages: true parallelism on multiprocessors, kernel can schedule threads independently, preemptive scheduling.  
  - Disadvantages: high overhead creating many kernel threads, not scalable for large numbers of user threads.  
- **Many-to-One model (User Space Threading):** Multiple user threads multiplexed on a single kernel thread.  
  - Advantages: very lightweight, eliminates kernel thread creation overhead, simple and efficient.  
  - Disadvantages: blocking system calls block the entire process (all user threads blocked), kernel unaware of user threads.  
- **Hybrid model:** Multiple user threads multiplexed over fewer kernel threads.  
  - Compromise between overhead and blocking issues.  
  - User threads can run in parallel on multiple kernel threads but still fewer context switches than one-to-one.  

**Problem statement:**  
Compare the advantages and disadvantages of one-to-one, many-to-one, and hybrid threading models with respect to thread creation overhead, blocking behavior, kernel visibility, performance, and scalability.

**Solution:**  
- One-to-one: best concurrency, true parallelism, high overhead, kernel sees all threads, supports preemption.  
- Many-to-one: lightweight, no kernel thread overhead, user-space multiplexing, kernel unaware of threads, blocking syscall blocks whole process.  
- Hybrid: balance of both; fewer kernel threads than user threads, better performance than many-to-one, less overhead than one-to-one, still potential blocking issues but reduced.  

_Summary: Understanding these threading models and their tradeoffs is fundamental. The professor explicitly indicated exam questions about these tradeoffs — "If I were to ask you this on the exam" style hints. Preparedness to explain these differences along with pros and cons is critical._

### 5. User Space Threading Library and Cooperativeness of Threads  
**Key Points**  
- Thread context switching (stack switching) requires no privileged instructions, can be implemented entirely in user space.  
- Threads are generally cooperative in user space threading, requiring explicit yields to switch threads.  
- Cooperative scheduler in user space does not require kernel involvement unless preemption or blocking IO is needed.  
- Kernel involvement is only necessary for preemptive scheduling or blocking IO/sleep operations.  
- This concept sets up understanding why we have separate user space schedulers and kernel schedulers in hybrid/many-to-one models.  

**Problem statement:**  
Explain why user space threading libraries can implement thread context switching without kernel privileges and what assumptions are made regarding thread cooperation.

**Solution:**  
- The `switch` function saves/restores processor registers and switches stacks by moving ESP register, which are non-privileged instructions executable in user mode.  
- Therefore, user space can maintain multiple stacks and switch between them without kernel support.  
- User space threading libraries rely on cooperative multitasking — threads yield control voluntarily.  
- Preemptive scheduling requires kernel intervention because only kernel can preempt executing threads.  

_Summary: This is a conceptual and practical example emphasizing that user space threads and cooperative scheduling can be done without kernel privileges. Professor suggested this is important enough to be an exam question and to be able to reason through this independently._

### 6. Dual Scheduler Model: User Space Scheduler and Kernel Space Scheduler  
**Key Points**  
- In hybrid or many-to-one threading models, there exist two schedulers simultaneously:  
  - User space scheduler manages user threads multiplexed on top of kernel threads.  
  - Kernel scheduler manages kernel threads and processes.  
- Kernel scheduler operates oblivious to user space threading in many-to-one, but is aware in one-to-one.  
- User space scheduler utilizes application semantic knowledge — can optimize scheduling with application-specific info (e.g., map vs reduce phases).  
- Kernel scheduler balances compute resources across processes and kernel threads.  

_Summary: The separation and interaction of user and kernel schedulers is an important system design concept. Understanding this layered scheduling mechanism is suggested to be critical and likely exam-relevant as hinted by the professor’s emphasis._

### 7. Exam Setup and Context about Midterm and Lab 3  
**Key Points**  
- Exam covers all material up to but excluding security: isolation and protection, kernel organization, virtual memory management, interrupts, concurrency, scheduling, user/kernel threads, OS & networking.  
- Exam questions are conceptual/system design oriented.  
- Lab 3 is the biggest lab, covering scheduling and threading library implementation, structured in parts with a checkpoint bonus.  

_Summary: This general context is important because the professor explicitly pointed out that exam questions will be conceptual and design-focused, not just lab implementation queries. Threads and scheduling are core topics around which exam questions will be structured._
