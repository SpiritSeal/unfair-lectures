### 1. Round Robin Scheduling Example
**Key Points:**
- Tuple format: (arrival time, burst time) for each process.
- Round robin scheduling runs processes in fixed time quanta.
- Issues with round robin:
  - Context switching overhead (although assumed zero here).
  - Inflexibility regarding process remaining time (e.g., P3 example).
  - Long wait times for some processes if queue is long.
- Metrics for evaluating scheduling:
  - End-to-end response time = exit time - arrival time.
  - Use distributions (mean, median, tail latency) to evaluate.
- Shortest Job First (SJF) or Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) can improve performance metrics.
- Round robin is starvation-free, fair, and simple but deadline-unaware and latency-insensitive.

**Problem statement:**
Given a set of processes represented as tuples (arrival time, burst time), simulate round robin scheduling with a given time quantum and track the execution order and completion times.

**Solution:**
- Processes run for fixed quantum times in round robin order.
- Once a process completes, it is removed.
- New arrivals are added at their arrival times.
- Run the processes in cycles, each time slicing for quantum or remaining burst time.
- Track running time intervals (black color) and waiting time intervals (gray).
- Highlight inefficiency in round robin, such as process being switched out despite short remaining time (e.g., P3 with 1 unit left switched out).

_Summary: This example clearly explains round robin scheduling mechanics, its fairness, simplicity and weakness in ignoring remaining time and deadlines. The professor emphasized ability to quantitatively compare scheduling policies using response times and distributions. The example is a probable exam question because of the explicit "if I were to ask you this on the exam" style reasoning._

### 2. Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) Scheduling Scenario
**Key Points:**
- Comparison with round robin scheduling example.
- SRTF picks the process with the shortest remaining burst time next.
- Time quanta interrupts cause scheduler context switch.
- The shortest remaining time for ready queue processes determines next run process.
- Preemption occurs if a process with a shorter remaining time arrives.

**Problem statement:**
Given the same set of processes and their remaining burst times during scheduling, determine which process would be scheduled next under shortest remaining time first policy after context switching (e.g., after P3’s quantum ends).

**Solution:**
- Check all runnable processes’ remaining times.
- In the example after P3’s quantum ends, runnable queue is P3, P4, P5 with remaining times 1, 6, 8 respectively.
- P3 has shortest remaining time = 1.
- Therefore, scheduler picks P3 again.

_Summary: The professor gave this as a follow-up question to the round robin example. It shows conceptual understanding of preemption and shortest remaining job heuristic. Likely exam question due to its direct relation to initial example and classroom emphasis._

### 3. Producer-Consumer Problem with Locks and Condition Variables
**Key Points:**
- Locks (mutexes) impose mutual exclusion and dynamic ordering but have weak ordering semantics.
- Locks alone cannot solve waiting efficiently; busy waiting causes inefficiency.
- Condition variables provide efficient waiting mechanism by sleep and wakeup.
- Wait (cv_wait) releases the lock and suspends thread until signaled.
- Signal wakes up one waiting thread; broadcast wakes up all.
- Spurious wakeups require that wait be done within a while loop checking condition.
- Safety and liveness properties must be maintained:
  - Without proper signaling, waiting threads may deadlock (no liveness).
  - Without while-loop checking, spurious wakeups can cause safety violations.
  - Signal must be correctly placed after critical section for proper happens-before relations.

**Problem statement:**
Implement a correct and efficient producer-consumer queue using locks and condition variables ensuring: no data races, no busy waiting, safety (no pop from empty), liveness (consumer eventually wakes), and efficiency.

**Solution:**
- Protect shared queue operations with locks.
- Consumer before popping checks in a while loop if queue is empty, and calls wait if so.
- Wait releases lock and suspends thread.
- Producer after pushing an element signals the condition variable to wake up a consumer.
- The signal must happen after queue modifications and while lock held to enforce happens-before.
- While loop prevents safety violations caused by spurious wakeups or race conditions where multiple consumers may race to pop the last element.

_Summary: This is a core synchronization example repeatedly emphasized by the professor as fundamental and error-prone in practice. The requirement for the while loop condition and placing signal properly is likely an exam question. The professor explicitly explains this in detail, including a tricky safety violation scenario with two consumers, spurious wakeups, and the reasoning behind weak ordering semantics of locks._

### 4. Happens-Before Relationship in Producer-Consumer Synchronization
**Key Points:**
- The pair of synchronization primitives signal and wait form a happens-before ordering.
- Push must happen before signal.
- Signal must happen before consumer wakes (wait returns).
- Wait returning before pop ensures pop happens after push.
- Proper ordering enforces correctness in shared resource usage.

**Problem statement:**
Explain why the order of signal and wait matters in producer-consumer synchronization and how happens-before guarantees are established to ensure no race conditions occur (push before pop).

**Solution:**
- Represent events as nodes in a directed acyclic graph: push, signal, wait, pop.
- There is an edge from push to signal because signal is called after push completes.
- There is an edge from signal to wait because signal triggers wait to complete.
- There is an edge from wait to pop because after waking, pop occurs.
- By transitivity, push happens before pop.
- Misplacing signal before push breaks this ordering and leads to race conditions.

_Summary: This conceptual question about ordering and happens-before relation is likely exam worthy, focusing on reasoning about synchronization correctness from first principles rather than memorization. The professor emphasized this strongly at the lecture end._

# Summary of Potential Exam Questions Found:
- Simulate round robin scheduling given process arrival and burst times, explain schedule and response times.
- Analyze shortest remaining time first scheduling decisions for same workload.
- Design producer-consumer queue with locks and condition variables, explain importance of while-loop waiting and signaling.
- Describe happens-before relations in producer-consumer synchronization and how signal and wait implement this.
- Define and apply datarace conditions precisely according to professor’s definition (two unordered accesses to same memory location, at least one write).

These examples reflect professor’s emphasis on understanding first principles, precise definitions, reasoning about liveness, safety, and efficiency properties, and the impact of different scheduling or synchronization policies on metrics like response time and correctness.
