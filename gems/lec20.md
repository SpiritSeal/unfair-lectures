### 1. File Systems and Their Properties (Introduction to File Systems)
**Key Points**
- File systems are abstractions to manage data persistently.
- Key properties: persistency, crash recovery, isolation, protection, durability.
- File systems do not necessarily require physical disks as backing storage (e.g., RAM disk, network-mounted file systems).
- Naming, protection, isolation, multiplexing (space and time multiplexing) are fundamental OS services enabled by file systems.
- File system interface evolved from Unix, applied to devices (e.g., /dev, procfs).
- File IO interface is general and has been extended beyond just persistent storage.

_Summary: This section grounds the understanding of what file systems are conceptually and what properties they must provide. The professor stresses isolation and protection as fundamental OS services that recur in multiple contexts (memory, networking, file systems). The idea that file systems are not limited to physical disks but include virtual/ephemeral or network-mounted file systems is emphasized._

### 2. File Systems Support Naming, Protection, Isolation, Multiplexing
**Key Points**
- Multiplexing of storage resources is essential to prevent interference.
- Two types of multiplexing: space multiplexing (sharing different parts of the file simultaneously) and time multiplexing (locking access sequentially).
- Naming is a crucial interface abstraction, hiding low-level details like blocks from users.

_Summary: This conceptual framework ties the file systems to fundamental OS concepts. The important distinction between types of multiplexing is highlighted and also linked back to networking, demonstrating an interconnected understanding._

### 3. Exam Hint: Tradeoff Space of Storage Technologies
**Key Points**
- Tradeoff between cost (x-axis) and throughput (y-axis).
- No one-size-fits-all "better" technology; depends on workload and requirements.
- Pareto frontier concept: maximize throughput given cost constraints and vice versa.
- Examples: tape (cheap, low throughput), HDDs, SSDs, DRAM, CPU SRAM cache.
- SSDs don't always outperform RAM disks for certain workloads (especially sequential writes).
- High-performance non-volatile memory (NVM) approaches RAM throughput but is expensive.

**"If I were to ask you this on the exam"**: "Which is better, tape or disk? The answer is 'it depends' based on application needs."

_Summary: The professor explicitly signals this topic as exam-relevant by phrasing it as a question he might ask. Understanding the performance-cost tradeoffs and the concept of the Pareto frontier is fundamental for systems design._

### 4. Log File Systems and Crash Recovery
**Key Points**
- Log keeps track of changes to the file system to enable crash recovery.
- File system consistency after crashes is a key challenge.
- Two upcoming lectures dedicated to ordering, atomicity, and concurrency in file systems focusing on implementing log file systems.
- Log file systems help handle intermittent availability (e.g., Andrew File System for mobile devices).
- Log: records changes but does not keep them indefinitely.

_Summary: The professor flags log file systems as an important topic, both conceptually and practically (upcoming labs and lectures). This will be a core topic for exam preparation, especially understanding how logs enable system recovery and concurrency control._

### 5. Inode and File Descriptor Distinction; On-Disk File System Layout
**Key Points**
- File descriptor ≠ file; multiple links (hard links) can point to the same file.
- Metadata (inode) must be stored separately from directories.
- Inode stores metadata and pointers to data blocks; maintains link counts to track when to free.
- Typical file system on-disk layout: boot sector, superblock, inode array, block bitmap, data blocks, log.
- XV6 specifics: boot block (block 0), superblock (block 1), then log (block 2), etc.
- Blocks typically match VM page size (e.g., 4KB = 8 sectors of 512 bytes) to optimize swapping.

**Problem Statement (Inode direct pointers and file size calculation):**  
"What is the maximum file size supported by an inode with 12 direct pointers and 1 indirect pointer, each block size 512 bytes?"  
"What is the largest file size supported in XV6?"

**Solution:**  
- Each direct pointer points to a 512-byte block → 12 * 512 = 6 KB maximum via direct pointers.  
- The indirect pointer points to a block that contains 128 pointers (each to 512-byte blocks), so 128 * 512 = 64 KB via indirect blocks.  
- Total max file size = 6 KB + 64 KB = 70 KB.

**"If I were to ask you on the exam"**: You may be asked to calculate the max file size given inode pointer structure details.

_Summary: This concrete example with inode pointer arithmetic and on-disk layout details is highlighted as warm-up questions and exam-relevant. Understanding why indirect pointers exist and how file sizes scale is critical. Professor also links inode size and disk structure, providing the reasoning behind sector/block size choices for swap efficiency._

### 6. Forensic Analysis and Offset Calculation in File Systems
**Problem Statement:**  
"Given an inode number, how do you compute its byte offset on disk?"  
- Inodes are 64 bytes long.  
- Boot sector (512 bytes) and superblock (512 bytes) occupy the first two blocks.  
- Byte address for inode i = (2 * 512) + (64 * i).

**Example:** Root directory inode (inode 0) is located at byte offset 1024.

_Summary: This calculation demonstrates how disk layouts are constructed and shows practical knowledge useful for system design or forensic purposes. This could appear as a direct exam question._

### 7. Exam-Relevant Concept: Matching Block Size to VM Page Size
**Key Points**
- Block size commonly matches virtual memory page size (4 KB).
- Reason: optimizing swapping of pages to disk in a one-to-one mapping between pages and blocks.
- Reduces bookkeeping complexity and improves efficiency.

_Summary: This principle links file systems and VM systems—highlighted as conceptually fundamental and likely exam worthy._
