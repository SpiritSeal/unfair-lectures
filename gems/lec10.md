### 1. Disk Swapping and Clock Algorithm for Page Eviction
**Key Points**
- Reviewing disk swapping as covered previously in 2200, emphasizing algorithmic understanding and conceptual questions.
- Explanation of why page eviction policy matters; memory access patterns are crucial.
- The ideal (oracular) policy is to evict pages that will not be used for the longest future time (Belady’s algorithm).
- Since we cannot know future accesses, least recently used (LRU) is a common heuristic.
- LRU tracking is expensive (trapping every access) and not practical due to overhead.
- The Clock algorithm approximates LRU by using a circular buffer and an "access bit" (A bit).
- Physical frames arranged in a circular buffer with a clock pointer scanning for pages to evict.
- Access bit set to 1 when page accessed; eviction resets bit to zero and advances pointer.
- Trap occurs only when trying to set A from 0 to 1 (not on each access), reducing overhead drastically.
- The access bit is shadowed by the PTE Present bit to cause traps on zero.
- Worst-case scenario of the Clock algorithm is a full scan through all pages with access bit set to 1 and resetting them to zero before eviction.
- This heuristic balances performance and overhead better than naive LRU.

**Problem statement (example):**  
Given four physical frames with their last access timestamps and a global clock counter, simulate accesses and page eviction decision according to the Clock algorithm described.

**Solution:**  
- Each frame has a timestamp representing last access.  
- Accessing a page updates its timestamp to the global clock counter and increments the counter.  
- When eviction is needed, check access bits: if set (1), clear it (set to 0) and advance; if clear (0), evict that page.  
- The clock hand moves circularly through the frames.  

_Summary: This is a fundamental example, potentially examinable, illustrating clock algorithm mechanics, overhead tradeoffs, and why LRU is approximated rather than implemented naïvely._

### 2. Importance and Mechanism of Interrupts
**Key Points**
- Interrupts handle unexpected asynchronous events (e.g., keyboard input, network packets).
- Without interrupts, paging would not work properly, as faults depend on traps.
- Scheduling depends on timer interrupts to switch processes.
- Interrupts enable error handling (e.g., non-maskable interrupts for critical failures).
- Interrupts push notifications to the CPU instead of polling, saving overhead and improving responsiveness.
- Polling is possible but inefficient due to constant checking for events.
- Interrupts are classified as hardware and software interrupts; software interrupts invoked by instructions (e.g., system calls).
- Hardware interrupts are maskable or non-maskable; the latter cannot be ignored for critical issues.

**Problem statement (exam-style question):**  
If interrupts were not available, describe how a keyboard driver might receive input and discuss pros and cons of such an approach.

**Solution:**  
- Without interrupts, the keyboard must be polled regularly by the OS.  
- Polling constantly queries if keystrokes are available.  
- Pros: simpler, no interrupt complexity.  
- Cons: wasteful CPU cycles checking repeatedly, risk of buffer overflow losing keystrokes, poor responsiveness.  
- Interrupts allow event-driven, asynchronous processing improving efficiency and correctness.  

_Summary: This thought experiment underpins why interrupts are fundamental, emphasizing interrupts vs polling tradeoffs—a common exam theme._

### 3. Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) and Privilege Levels
**Key Points**
- Each interrupt is assigned a vector number indexing into the IDT.
- System calls use software interrupts (e.g., vector 64 or 0x40).
- Interrupt handling requires checking privilege levels to prevent unauthorized user access to privileged instructions.
- At interrupt entry, the CPU saves user state, switches from user stack to kernel stack via the TSS, and sets up environment for handler.
- The CPU loads CS and EIP from the IDT entry to jump to the interrupt handler.
- Privilege checks prevent user space from arbitrarily invoking privileged interrupts.

**Problem statement (exam-style question):**  
Explain the steps the CPU takes when handling an interrupt from user space, focusing on privilege checks and stack switching.

**Solution:**  
- CPU receives interrupt vector number.  
- Fetch interrupt descriptor from IDT.  
- Check current privilege level against descriptor’s privilege; deny if insufficient.  
- Save current user stack pointer (ESP, SS).  
- Load new stack pointer and segment from TSS for kernel stack.  
- Push user stack info (SS, ESP), flags (EFLAGS), code segment (CS), and instruction pointer (EIP) onto kernel stack.  
- Clear interrupt flags as necessary.  
- Load CS and EIP from descriptor and jump to handler.  

_Summary: Detailed understanding of interrupt entry, privilege enforcement, and stack switching is fundamental and likely exam material._
